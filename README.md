## **Built for the Superteam Nigeria x Honeycomb Protocol Bounty**

**HIVESCRIBE** is a replayable progression based single player quizz game where players evolve through the **bee lifecycle**. It leverage the HoneyComb Protocol even though as it is not a full rpg game, to track player traits, reward mission completion, and evolve through on-chain reward mechanics. It combine the concept of wallet identity, mission logic, and on-chain progression into a unified gameplay loop.

## Game Concept

--- Grow from **Larva to Hive** â€” by answering blockchain themed questions.
--- Earn **XP** stored on-chain using the **Honeycomb Protocol** for each correct question. And climb up each stages as your XP threshold changes
--- Complete Missions and get th **Nectar**
--- XP can also be converted to Nectar and a stage in the game.

### Stages:

- **Larva** (0 XP)
- **Pupa** (8 XP)
- **Worker Bee** (16 XP)
- **Hive** (30 XP)
- **Honey** (Final stage, then you unlock competitive gameplay)

## Why This Project Matters

HiveScribe shows how **Honeycomb Protocol** can be used beyond simplifying backend tracking for games on the solana blockchain, it becomes a _core part of game mechanics_:

- Missions define progress
- Traits power stage evolution
- All actions can be linked to player identity on-chain.

## Tech Stack so far

- **Solana Wallet Adapter (Phantom)**
- **Honeycomb Protocol** for missions and traits
- **React + Vite** for the frontend
- **LocalStorage** for dev-mode caching
  integration targets: Verxio, Solana Pay.

## Submission Note!

**Why did i Submit this Now?**
The submission page states that winners will be announced **July 30**, but also shows a confusing count down timer. Rather than risk missing the judging deadline, I'm submitting this MVP now to ensure this concept of gameplay gets reviewed.
