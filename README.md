# **A Progressive On-Chain Quiz Game Built for the Superteam Nigeria Bounty**

**HIVESCRIBE** is a replayable, single-player quiz game that leverages the Honeycomb Protocol to create a replayable, progression-based gameplay loop built around the
**bee lifecycle**. By integrating on-chain traits, missions, and player evolution, we demonstrate how the Honeycomb Protocol can be used as the **core engine for game mechanics and player identity on Solana**.

# 🐝 The Gameplay Loop: Larva to Hive

Players evolve through the stages of a bee's lifecycle by answering blockchain-themed questions. The game tracks their progress entirely on-chain.

- Larva (0 XP): The starting stage.

- Pupa (8 XP): Players begin to form their identity.

- Worker Bee (16 XP): Ready to collect resources.

- Hive (30 XP): The final stage, where players can mint their earned Honey.

# Core progression:

1. **Earn XP:** Players gain **XP** for each correct answer. This XP is stored on-chain using the Honeycomb Protocol and determines their current stage.

2. **Complete Missions:** Answering all questions in a given mission rewards players with Nectar.

3. **Convert XP to Nectar:** Once a player reaches the Hive stage, they can convert their earned XP into Nectar.

4. **Mint Honey:** With enough Nectar, players can mint a final, collectible Honey NFT, signifying their completion of the lifecycle and unlocking competitive features.
